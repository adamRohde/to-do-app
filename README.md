# Todo App
Simple todo app that helps you NOT FORGET WHAT YOU NEED TO DO!  Uses vanilla js for the business logic.  Allows the options of saving into local storage so the items will retain through a refresh.  "Save List" needs to be checked in the drop down menu to enable the local storage. 

This was one of my first projects learning Web Developement. The way I handled local storage is not something I would do again. Using <li> elements would of made things much simpler. I keep it unchanged as an example of what first principles look like, when you aren't aware of a second. There are many ways to solve a problem, granted if you are making a to-do app, I probably wouldn't recommend this one. . .  Just use <li>  ;)
